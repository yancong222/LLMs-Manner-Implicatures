The datasets consist of two types. The first type includes a dataset we created using specific templates. For manner implicatures triggered by causality and modality, we expanded a published experimental pragmatics stimulus set from Wilson (2016). For manner implicatures triggered by negation, we extracted sentences from the British National Corpus (BNC) written data that contain adjectives used in previous research by Aina (2019), which examined the distributional vector representations of 184 pairs of English adjectives.

The second type, referred to as the target dataset, consists of existing, widely-cited datasets. This includes 1,199 entailment and implied sentence pairs extracted from a well-known scalar implicature dataset, focused on scalar implicatures triggered by quantifiers. Additionally, we included 1,094 sentence pairs with neutral relations, drawn from the Stanford Natural Language Inference corpus (SNLI).

The datasets in this folder refer to the first type.
